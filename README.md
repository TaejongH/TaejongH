# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Just thinking about what kind of app i want to make and decide how to progressively approach in terms of difficulty...
- Make a console-based chess game(with classes and functions for rule checking? Updating I/O asynch?)
- Pomodoro webapp/cross platform app for myself would be nice.
